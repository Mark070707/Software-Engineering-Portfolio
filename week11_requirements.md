# Software Engineering Week11 submission Project work 4

## The Task

Week 10 is the third and last week in a series in which the goal is to improve your 
personal software engineering practice. Your portfolio entry has the same general content
as last week's, including:

* A descriptive summary of the issue that you worked on.
* Snippets from your code with commentary showing how you have used good software design 
  practice.
* A descriptive summary of the test code that you have written.
* A reflective summary of any changes that were requested during the code review along 
  with your fixes.
* A descriptive summary of any issues you found with the code that you were asked to review.
* A general reflective section that identifies, for example,
  * New things you have realised this week
  * Common problems that can arise in a team development situation
  * How your practice compares to other people's
  * etc.

Be sure to include links to the original items in the team's GitHub repository.

In the reflective sections this week, you should highlight ways that you persona practice
has improved as before. It would also be good to reflect on any improvements that have
been made to the agreed team workflow and related procedures. Are things working
better than they were? What further improvements could be made in the future?

## The Issue number



## Reflection
Over the past weeks, my journey in contributing to our team project on GitHub has been
marked by notable progress in both personal and team aspects, this has been a slow
learning curve to start with but feel it has been getting better.

Personal Growth:
In terms of code reviewing and GitHub navigation, I've experienced significant improvements.
The platform is becoming more enjoyable as I delve deeper into its functionalities.
One key realization has been the importance of adhering to coding principles. If i look back at
code i was producing before this modual it was very different, i have always felt i have had to
explain my code, but now it is alot clearer and the need for comments has reduced.

While I've become adept at crafting more efficient tests, the realm of mock testing has presented
a challenge. Acknowledging this, I am committed to dedicating more time to research and implementation,
aiming to have it seamlessly integrated into our project by the final report.

Team Workflow and Procedure Enhancements:
Collaboratively, our team has made commendable strides in the efficiency of issue resolution and code
review processes. Notably, there has been an uptick in active participation, with constructive feedback
becoming more commonplace. The team message comunication has ben more responsive in the spen of replys which
is great for team repport. This collective effort has contributed to a quicker turnaround in completing
tasks. I have found myself being able to complete more issues in and reviews in the same period of time.

Recognizing the need for improvement, I've identified disparities in my approach to error handling
and testing compared to my peers. This awareness serves as a catalyst for continuous improvement
in these areas.

In addressing common team challenges, we've initiated efforts to mitigate miscommunication.
Regular updates, where everyone shares their progress and challenges, have become a valuable practice. Although participation in these conversations is not uniform, the mere initiation of such discussions signifies an improvement in team communication.
As I reflect on these aspects of my journey, the commitment to continual learning and enhancement
remains at the forefront. I look forward to further refining my skills and contributing meaningfully
to our collaborative efforts.

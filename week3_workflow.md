# Software Engineering Week3 submission


## The Task
1. Know how to use the workflow tools in GitHub
2. Successfully complete required operations which are:
   * Accept a task from the project backlog
   * Update the task information appropriately
   * Update the task board appropriately
   * Complete the development task on a feature branch
   * Commit your changes with appropriate comments
   * Check your work against the Definition of Done (DoD)
   * Make a pull request

## Task workflow

Here, you should use screenshots and descriptive commentary to show that the required
have been completed successfully.

**DO**

* Consider the layout of your content from the point of view of the reader. Many raw
  screenshots will take up a lot of space. It may be better to adopt a different strategy
  such as
  * Using thumbnails with links to full-size images
  * Combining two or more screenshots into a single image 
  * Using partial screenshots to highlight only the important information
  * etc.
* Provide links to the actual objects (e.g. task, pull request, etc.) in the team project
  in GitHub
* Read through your work to make sure that the information comes across clearly

**DON'T**

* Use humour or informal language
* Waste space with trivial or self-evident commentary
* Abbreviate your commentary using (e.g. by using bullet points). Your text should be in
  the form of grammatically correct sentences.








## Reflection

Here, you should highlight any difficulties that you faced in completing the task, and
how you resolved them.

You should also briefly discuss the current process and how it could be refined or
improved in future iterations. For example, is the DoD adequate or too onerous? Is the
current procedure for updating the task appropriate? Is the task board configured to
work in an intuitive way?

My main two dificulties were comunication with my team and my lack of knowlwdge and
understanding of how complete the database task. The comunication problem was first
highlighted to me when i was in class trying to understand this weeks task. i have realised
this because of the large size of the team and that not everyone sits together, there seems to be
smaller sub teams forming and having there own discussions and understandings of the
required tasks. To combat this issue i went round the differnet clusters of sub groups
to converse with them. I found out that some people recived an email from the lecturer
that explains the issues are now available on GitHub to copy and paste over to our work
flow and start working on them, and some people did not revieve such an email. I have to
admit that i did not know how to complete the database workflow issue task. To combat these
problems i have messaged everyone on our discord Green Team group chat to comunicate our
ideas and concerns as a team. From now on i will gather the whole Green Team during the
practical class to have an in person meeting everyweek so we are all on the same page.

I like the task board, the simple look and feel that it provides. Its easy to read and understand with the
different colours to seperate the sections. It is also cusomisable if you wanted to show a tasks importance or prioraty.
I would change one thing, to have administative access to amend or add to the task board as i see fit.
at the moment i do not have any control and look to change this.

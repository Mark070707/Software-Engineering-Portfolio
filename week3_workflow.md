# Software Engineering Week3 submission


## The Task
1. Know how to use the workflow tools in GitHub
2. Successfully complete required operations which are:
   * Accept a task from the project backlog
   * Update the task information appropriately
   * Update the task board appropriately
   * Complete the development task on a feature branch
   * Commit your changes with appropriate comments
   * Check your work against the Definition of Done (DoD)
   * Make a pull request

## Task workflow

Here, you should use screenshots and descriptive commentary to show that the required
have been completed successfully.

**DO**

* Consider the layout of your content from the point of view of the reader. Many raw
  screenshots will take up a lot of space. It may be better to adopt a different strategy
  such as
  * Using thumbnails with links to full-size images
  * Combining two or more screenshots into a single image 
  * Using partial screenshots to highlight only the important information
  * etc.
* Provide links to the actual objects (e.g. task, pull request, etc.) in the team project
  in GitHub
* Read through your work to make sure that the information comes across clearly

**DON'T**

* Use humour or informal language
* Waste space with trivial or self-evident commentary
* Abbreviate your commentary using (e.g. by using bullet points). Your text should be in
  the form of grammatically correct sentences.

## Reflection

Here, you should highlight any difficulties that you faced in completing the task, and
how you resolved them.

You should also briefly discuss the current process and how it could be refined or
improved in future iterations. For example, is the DoD adequate or too onerous? Is the
current procedure for updating the task appropriate? Is the task board configured to
work in an intuitive way?

My first dificulty was comunication with my team. The comunication problem was first
highlighted to me when i was in class trying to understand this weeks task. i have realised
that because of the large size of the team and that not everyone sits together, there seems to be
smaller sub teams forming and having there own discussions and understandings of the
required tasks. To combat this issue i went round the differnet clusters of sub groups
to converse with them. I found out that some people recived an email from the lecturer
that explains the issues are now available on GitHub to copy and paste over to our work
flow and start working on them, and some people did not revieve such an email.
From now on i will gather the whole Green Team during the practical class to have an
in person meeting everyweek so we are all on the same page.

The second dificulty was i could not add or edit the team workflow. There has been no issues added
to it so i could not start the task. I messaged everyone on our discord Green Team group chat to comunicate
my concerns and was told someone will get round to it when they have time. I have limited time to complete
my course work due to family commitments and work schedules so i could not wait. Instaed i made my own workflow
dashboard and added an issue myself so i can take screenshots and still demonstaight my understanging of the tools
in GitHub. Going forward i will speak to the Green team and see if there is anyway that i can be added as an
administrator to be adble to add and edit the issues.

The third problem was my lack of knowlwdge and understanding of how complete the database workflow issue task.
I messaged everyone on our discord Green Team group chat to comunicate my concerns but was met with a simalar respone
that they did not know how to complete the issue. Instead i focussed my attention on navagating the workflow dashbard.

I like the task board, the simple look and feel that it provides. Its easy to read and understand with the
different colours to seperate the sections. It is also cusomisable if you wanted to show a tasks importance or prioraty.
It seems easy to use and upload work that has been commited.

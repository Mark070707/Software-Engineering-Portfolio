## workflow

I have accepted a task from the team project dashboard and assigned it to myself shown in figure 1.

The next screenshot in figure 3 is showing that the issue has been taken out of the queue of tasks
to be worked on and now in the process section where work is being carried out.

Figure 4 shows the issues details and instructions on how to complete the issue. From here we can also make changes,
change the status, upload files and add comments for other team members to be kept up to date with progress that is being made.

Figure 5 shows a branch has been made and a pull request has been done.

Figure 6 shows a screenshot of my 2 branches. I made 1 branch called "MarkAbram-branch" that is a branch of the "main" branch.
Then i have made a branch called "branch-of-MarkAbram-branch" that is a branch of "MarkAbram-branch". The reason for this was so
i could demonstrate merging a pull request into a branch without affecting the main branch.

## Reflection

My first difficulty was communication with my team. The communication problem became evident to me during
a class while trying to understand this week's task. I realized that due to the large size of the team and
the fact that not everyone sits together, smaller sub-teams seem to be forming, each with its own discussions
and understanding of the required tasks. To address this issue, I took the initiative to visit different
clusters of sub-groups and engage in conversations with them. I discovered that some team members received
an email from the lecturer explaining that the tasks were available on GitHub for copying and pasting into
our workflow, while others did not receive such an email. Moving forward, I plan to gather the entire Green
Team during practical classes to hold in-person meetings every week to ensure we are all on the same page.

The second challenge I encountered was my inability to add or edit the team workflow. Since no issues had
been added to it, I couldn't begin the task. I reached out to everyone in our Discord Green Team group chat
to communicate my concerns and was informed that someone would attend to it when they had time. However,
due to my limited availability caused by family commitments and work schedules, I couldn't afford to wait.
Instead, I created my own workflow dashboard and added an issue myself so I could take screenshots and
demonstrate my understanding of GitHub tools. Going forward, I will discuss with the Green Team to explore
the possibility of being added as an administrator to have the capability to add and edit issues.

The third problem I faced was my lack of knowledge and understanding of how to complete the database workflow issue task.
I communicated my concerns to everyone in our Discord Green Team group chat but received a similar response
indicating that they were unsure how to complete the issue. As a result, I focused my attention on navigating
the workflow dashboard.

I appreciate the task board for its simplicity, making it easy to use and understand. The different colors used
to separate sections and the option for customization to indicate task importance or priority are particularly
useful. It appears user-friendly and efficient for uploading committed work.

# Software Engineering Week2 submission


## The Task
  Creating a shared GitHub repository for the team.
  Setting up a project in GitHub with an integrated task board.
  Configuring a personal copy of Visual Studio appropriately.
  Cloning the shared repository.


## Environment configuration

  I have set up my development envirnment successfully. Visual Studio is now connected to GitHub Grean Team and cloned personal
  repositories. Screen shot Evidence of the installed Visual Studio showing the cloned week2 portfolio instructions
  information taken from my own GitHub repository is avalable here- [Visual Studio evidence](https://github.com/Mark070707/Software-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/main/images/Visual%20Studio%20screenshot.png)

  I have downloaded GitHub Desktop to my Macbook and connected it to the Green Teams repository and my own
  repository named "Software-Engineering-Portfolio" on Visual Studio, screenshot evidence of GitHub working
  with my repositoeies can be seen here- [GitHub evidence](https://github.com/Mark070707/Software-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/main/images/GitHub%20screenshot.png)


## Reflection

  I understand that there are different configuration setups available. One of them involves using Git version control
  directly from the terminal on my MacBook, while another option is using Visual Studio to connect to GitHub repositories
  on the website. I have chosen to download GitHub Desktop to my MacBook and update the repositories via markdown language
  on Visual Studio. The reason for my choice of setup was that it was the only configuration that actually worked with
  my MacBook.

  One limitation of using GitHub Desktop is that you cannot see the repository information as you would on the GitHub
  website (in preview mode). You can only view it in Visual Studio (in code mode). However, there is a button on GitHub
  Desktop that takes you to the website to view the repository as a web page. GitHub Desktop appears to be primarily used
  for pushing and fetching data to and from Visual Studio and GitHub repositories, which is fine with me.

  This is my first time using GitHub, and I found it challenging to make it work seamlessly with Visual Studio. I tried
  watching many YouTube videos to set up GitHub, but this did not work either. I asked my lecturer for assistance but was
  reminded that the whole point of this exercise is to utilize my team and internet resources to resolve my problems. At
  first, I felt a bit lost. However, after following my lecturer's advice by communicating with my peers, I found the
  answers I was looking for and more. I not only discovered that the Mac operating system works best when using the
  desktop version of GitHub, but I also built rapport with my team. I can now see the benefits of building relationships
  within a team environment, and I am very happy with my progress so far.

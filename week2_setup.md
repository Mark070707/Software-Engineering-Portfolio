# Software Engineering Week2 submission



## Environment configuration

  I have set up my development envirnment successfully. Visual Studio is now connected to GitHub repositories.
  Screen shot Evidence of the installed Visual Studio showing the week2 portfolio instructions information taken
  from my own GitHub repository is avalable here-

  I have downloaded GitHub Desktop to my Macbook and connected it to the Green Teams repository and my own
  repository named "Software-Engineering-Portfolio" on Visual Studio, screenshot evidence of GitHub working
  with my repositoeies can be seen here-

## Reflection

  I understand that there is different configeration setups available, one of them being using git version control
  directly from the terminal on my MacBook, or using Visual studio to connect to GitHub website reposotories.
  I have chosen to download Github Desktop to my MacBook and update the repositories via markdown language on
  Visual Studio. The reason for my setup choice was that it was the only configeration that actually worked with my
  MacBook.

  The limitations of using Desktop GitHub is that you cannot see the repository information as you would see it
  on the GitHub web page, you can only view it on Visual Studio, however there is a button on GitHub Desktop
  that takes you to the website to view the repository as a web page. The GitHub Desktop seems to only be used
  to push and fetch the data to and from Visual Studio and GitHub repositories which is fine with me.

  This is my first time using GitHub and found it challenging to get it to work in harmony with Visual Studio.
  I tried watching many YouTube videos to set up GitHub but this did not work either. I asked my lecturer for
  assistance but was reminded that the whole point of this exercise is to utilise your team and internet resources
  to resolve my problems. At first i found a bit lost, however after following my lecurures advice by comunicating
  with my peers, i found the answers i was looking for and more. I was not only able to find out that Mac operating
  system work best when using the desktop version of GitHub, i was also able to build rapport with my team. I can now
  see the benifit building relationships with in a team enviroment and i am very happy with my progress so far.

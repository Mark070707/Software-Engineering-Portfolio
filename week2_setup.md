# Software Engineering Week2 submission

The main requirements are to show that:

My tasks are:
1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

## Environment configuration

Here, you should include appropriate screenshots with additional commentary. 

**DO**

* Place your image files in the `images` folder
* Choose your screenshots carefully so that they communicate the appropriate information.
  Many screenshots with no clear purpose or with trivial differences are of little value.
* Provide <ins>descriptive</ins> commentary to explain why the screenshot is included. 
  what it shows and point out any particularly significant details.
* Modify your screenshots - for example, by adding arrows, outlines or other highlighting 
  techniques - to enhance their communication value.
* Remove unnecessary material from your screenshots such as toolbars, other windows and 
  computer desktop to eliminate distractions.
* Ensure that any important content is clearly legible. Pay particular attention to text
  size and image resolution.
* Use [numbered captions](https://towardsdev.com/3-ways-to-add-a-caption-to-an-image-using-markdown-f2ca30562be6) 
  as labels for images. Also, use the caption numbers to refer to images in your text.

**DON'T**

* Expect the reader to understand your reasons for including a screenshot. If you can't
  explain it, the screenshot will not do the job on its own.
* Include self-evident comments. For example, don't simply list the values used on a
  configuration page if those values are clearly visible in the screenshot.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.

  I have set up my development envirnment successfully. Visual Studio is now connected to GitHub repositories.
  Screen shot Evidence of the installed Visual Studio showing the week2 portfolio instructions data taken
  from my own GitHub repository is avalable here-

  I have downloaded GitHub Desktop to my Macbook and connected it to the Green Teams repository and my own
  repository named "Software-Engineering-Portfolio" on Visual Studio, screenshot
  evidence of GitHub working with my repositoeies can be seen here-

  I understand that there is different configeration setups available, one of them being using git version control
  directly from the terminal, or using Visual studio to connect to GitHub website reposotories. I have chosen to
  download Github Desktop to my MacBook and update the repositories via markdown language on Visual Studio.

  This is my first time using GitHub and found it challenging to get it to work in harmony with Visual
  Studio. I watched many YouTube videos to help my understanding of what GitHub is used for.
